# Thanks GPT-4o
# Procedure:
"""
> I'm probing the activations of a language model and I want to distinguish misconceptions from true answers. 
I want to create a true/false question such that "question question question? yes" is likely to be continued by misconceived/unreliable text.
The misconception should be one that I might actually encounter if I went out and interviewed people. Generate 10 such misconceptions.
Remember to make them diverse, but commonly believed.
...
> Rephrase them to make the phrasing more diverse and gramatically correct
...
I manually inverted them all because GPT-4 frequently rephrased them without changing the answer (and checked that the answers were correct)
...
> {Previous misconceptions pasted into new chat session} Now, suggest 10 diverse examples of error. These should not be scientific misconceptions, but other kinds of error e.g. mathematical or logical; they should be somewhat common kinds of error.
...
> Make the phrasing more diverse
...
Manually inverted again + checked answers.
